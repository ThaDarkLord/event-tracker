# event-tracker

## Description
The Musicial Event Locator is a tool for fans to find out what events will be held in their city. The motivation for this application was to make finding events fast and simple. This application will allow the user to pinpoint a number of concerts in their local or surrounding cities and states. Through this project the team learned that we have a long way to go in our developer journeys. Implementation of your ideas aren't always going to go as planned but if you plan properly you will be able to accomplish more with less work.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
